# MHRD Logic Gate Extraction
Since there is no native way of exporting user created logic gates in [MHRD](http://store.steampowered.com/app/576030/), this tool was created to extract the local user's logic gates and export them as .txt files.

## Usage
1. Download the released executable file from this repository
2. Make sure the executable and the savestate file are in the same folder
> savestate file location:
> 1. Steam > Right Click on MHRD > Properties
> 2. Open MHRD's local folder
> 3. The savestate file is located in: userdata\
3. Copy the savestate file to where the the executable is
4. Run the executable
> The executable will generate a text file in the current directory for each logic gate.
